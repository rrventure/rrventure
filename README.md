- 👋 Hi, I’m @rrventure
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out how to use Github so I can start creating with my fellow developers to make the future even more incredible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything one day at a time on how to full stack devop.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with like minded entreprenuers that have big goals as I myself have been self employed for eight years thru lots of trial and tribulations.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my TikTok DM: AskTheBroker
